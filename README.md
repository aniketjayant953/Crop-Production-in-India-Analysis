# Crop Production Analysis Dashboard

## Introduction

This dataset offers extensive information on crop production in India from 1997 to 2014, revealing key shifts and trends. The monsoon season consistently leads in production but shows a downward trend over time. The North region has stable production, while the East region has declined and the West Zone and Union Territory have increased their production. Notably, Whole Year Season production has declined since 2003, whereas Winter and Monsoon Seasons have seen growth post-2003. The goal is to predict future crop production and identify key indicators and metrics that influence it, providing valuable insights for improving agricultural productivity in India.

## Data Details

The dataset consists of crop production data, including:
- States and regions
- Types of crops
- Seasons
- District-level production and cultivation areas
- Year-to-year production trends
- Key metrics such as total production, highest production crops, and regional production insights

## Important KPIs

- Total Production of Crops
- Production Trends by Region
- Seasonal Production Trends
- Top Producing Crops
- District-level Production and Cultivation Areas

## Insights

### Home Page

- **Top 3 Crops by Production**: Sugarcane, Rice, Wheat
  - Sugarcane: Highest production, with Uttar Pradesh leading in both production and cultivation area. Maximum production when sown throughout the year.
  - Rice: Second highest production, with West Bengal leading in production but highest cultivation area in Uttar Pradesh. Maximum production during the monsoon season.
  - Wheat: Third highest production, with Uttar Pradesh leading in both production and cultivation area. Maximum production during the winter season.
- **Regional Production**: North India has the maximum production among all zones.

### District Page

- Top 3 districts in production and cultivation area belong to Uttar Pradesh.
- Dominant districts in production and cultivation areas vary by state:
  - West Bengal: Murshidabad, Midnapur West, Hooghly
  - Uttar Pradesh: Muzaffarnagar, Kheri, Bijnor
- Variety of crops does not necessarily correlate with maximum production:
  - Karnataka has the highest number of crops but not the highest production.
  - Chandigarh has the lowest variety of crops.
- 59 different types of crops are cultivated in 646 districts of India.

### Coconut Page

- Coconut dominates the dataset with Kerala leading in production (100 billion coconuts).
- Southern region has the highest production with a total area of 28 million required to produce 100 billion coconuts.
- Coconut production occurs year-round, not restricted by seasons.
- In 2011, a spike in production increased the demand for coconut across the country.

### Time Series Page

- Monsoon season leads in production but shows a downward trend over time.
- Crop yield shows a slight upward trend, reflecting improvements in productivity over the years.
- North region maintains consistent production, while the East region shows an initial improvement but trends downward. Other regions have lower and stable production levels.

### Production Page

- Maximum growth in production occurred between 2007 and 2008.
- Steepest decline in growth was observed between 1997 and 1998.
- Regional Production Trends:
  - North Zone: Decrease in production.
  - West Zone and Union Territory: Increase in production.
- Seasonal Production Trends:
  - Whole Year Season: Decline post-2003.
  - Winter and Monsoon Seasons: Increase post-2003.
- Sugarcane is highlighted for its significant production value.
